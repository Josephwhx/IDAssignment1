# Tea Leaf
Tea Leaf is an e-commerce website that sells a variety of tea stashes/bags to their customers as well as to educate them on the benefits of the various type of tea.

## Design Process
Since Tea Leaf is an e-commerce website, it's target consumer would probably be people that loves tea or people that wants to purchase tea. With that in mind, i decided to use more of a neutral color such as white and black.
